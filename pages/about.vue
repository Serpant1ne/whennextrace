    I hate making calendar events for races each year manually. This service can
    combine multiple racing series in the 2025 season and give it as a events
    for your calendar. Choose your favorite racing series and click export
    below. After that import the file to the calendar of your choice. Enjoy! If
    there isn't a racing series that you wanted - I didn't make a database for
    that yet.
